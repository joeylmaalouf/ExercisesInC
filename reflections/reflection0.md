##### Sprint Reflection

This sprint, we formed a group (me, Sean, Shruti, Apurva) based on our prioritized topics; we all ranked operating systems first, optimization second, and networks third on our lists of interesting topics. Unfortunately, Shruti had to drop the course, but she still greatly contributed to our discussions of what project we'd like to do. We all talked about what sort of ideas we had regarding operating systems and any related projects, and narrowed our options down to a list of four possible choices.

At this point, we decided to work on our scrum board. I became the scrum master, and we all came up with some generic tasks to put into our sprint backlog. At our next meeting, we selected the project that we really wanted to work on (custom shell), and redid the scrum tasks to be more specific.

I'm a little apprehensive regarding the scope of our project; is it too little or too much? However, I'm not too worried because we chose a fairly modular project, and can add or skip bonus features (like autocomplete) if necessary.
